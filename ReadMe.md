# Blocky - iOS SMS Filter

## 100% Offline & Private

Blocky allows you to create custom filters that stop all those spam SMS messages you receive.

For example, if you have noticed you are receiving many spam messages containing the words "click here" then you can use Blocky to set up a filter for all messages containing those words (Blocky only filters messages from senders who are not in your contacts).

Want something more complex? You can even create filters using Regular Expressions!

Blocky runs all logic on-device with zero tracking - making it 100% private.

### Development Info

Most of this code is... NSLayoutConstraints. The bulk of the project was built over a weekend, then bug fixing and user testing was completed after work the following week.

There are some unit tests for the filtering logic and a UI test that helps record the App Preview video.

Pull requests welcome, of course. Privacy is our #1 priority!
